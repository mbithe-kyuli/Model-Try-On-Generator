# Model-Try-On-Generator

Full-stack web application for generating studio-quality e-commerce visuals.

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application developed showcasing a practical implementation of AI-driven e-commerce image generation.

The application successfully manages the complete workflow, from user upload to the display of highly realistic, professional, and enhanced product images.

## Core Functionality

The application takes two user-uploaded photos—a human model and a clothing item—and processes them through a powerful AI model to generate four key images required for modern e-commerce listings.

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js framework for a clean, intuitive UI and smooth interaction, including loading indicators and clear user feedback.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Node.js (Express) to handle secure multi-part file uploads and act as a crucial proxy to the AI API.
- **AI/Image Generation**: Synthesize complex images, with a focus on photorealistic rendering, accurate shadow integration, and realistic fabric texture to ensure the outputs look like professional photography, not generic AI art.
